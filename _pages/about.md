Hello! I am broadly interested in using <b>computational methods</b> and <b>machine learning</b> techniques to help scientists design and develop new <b>catalytic and energy materials</b> more efficiently. I am currently supervised by [Alan Aspuru-Guzik](http://matter.toronto.edu). 

I was a Research Engineer at the [Institute of High Performance Computing](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ihpc/ihpc-research-capabilities/materials-science-chemistry) in the [Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR)](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/) in Singapore. Before this, I graduated with a B.Sc (Hons) in Chemistry from the [National University of Singapore](https://chemistry.nus.edu.sg/). I was also part of the [University Scholars Programme](https://www.usp.nus.edu.sg/), a selective interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary academic program.

I currently volunteer with [Pueblo Science](https://www.puebloscience.org/), an organization based in Toronto that helps underprivileged communities have greater access to STEM education.
